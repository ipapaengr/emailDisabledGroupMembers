This PowerShell script retrieves the list of disabled users from a specified Active Directory group and sends an email notification to a specified recipient. The email subject includes the name of the group.

The script can be used to monitor the status of users in a particular group and take appropriate action if necessary. The script is flexible and can be customized to suit different needs, such as checking other user properties or group types, or including additional information in the email body.

The script requires the ActiveDirectory PowerShell module and can be scheduled to run periodically using a task scheduler or other automation tool.
